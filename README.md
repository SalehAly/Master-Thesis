M.Sc. Topic: Context-Sensitive Pervasive Computing for Smart Cities

Introduction to IoT
===================

Internet of Things **IoT** is one of the most trending topics in the
technology industry. It is a term that denotes a network with different
sensors like a camera, motion or light sensors and many others,
connecting several of our daily life components allowing them to
collect, exchange and share Information. Moreover, it allows the network
to control them, for instance, imagine being able to control the lights,
oven, heater or any other domestic device from your phone or laptop that
connects to the IoT network.

Autonomous Sensor Platform
==========================

Given that an IoT network connects to a lot of sensors with different
nature and input information and thus different data models, it has
become very hard to deal with all this data models. Also, gathering data
on an IoT network has its weak points, where are all this data going to
be stored ?, IoT networks are fairly known to be of small capacity and
computation capabilities.

In this topic we wish to explore and try to answer some of the research
questions that remains unanswered.

Data Modeling
-------------

Can we come up with data model that best suits all the types of input
information which are gathered from the sensors and connected devices ?

Data Storage, Distribution & Consistency
----------------------------------------

What is the best database engine to use in order to facilitate data
storage and to be able to query this data in an efficient way.
Furthermore, can we distribute the data among other IoT networks and
devices, so that we can overcome the problem of data capacity on these
IoT networks ?, and if we can distribute the data, how can we handle
data consistency ?.

Computation & Limitations
-------------------------

How can we generically and dynamically ask the network to compute
expressions for our needs?\
What are the limitations of the current IoT networks in terms of
computation power, what could be computed on the network itself and what
must be delegated to other servers with higher computation power

Security & Privacy
------------------

How can we keep this information secure? and does doing computation on
IoT network provides more privacy by not storing private information on
the cloud ?.

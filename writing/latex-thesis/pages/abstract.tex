Lately, research and development in Internet of Things, pervasive computing and machine-to-machine communication have been trending  in the computer science industry. In addition to the increase of pervasive use cases targeting to enhance the  life quality of human beings and preserve the environment. In turn, this has nurtured  the usage of networking concepts such as Information-Centric, Delay-Tolerant architectures and publish-subscribe messaging systems.  Despite all that, there is still a lack of frameworks that facilitates the distribution and harmonization of pervasive use cases. Therefore, we propose a software framework for distributing flows which are representations of computations describing use cases to smart devices in a network. The framework also takes care of the flows dependencies, resources, data communication, service discovery, delivering computations and data to challenged networks.

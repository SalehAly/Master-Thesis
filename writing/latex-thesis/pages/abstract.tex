In recent years, research and development in Internet of Things, pervasive computing and machine-to-machine communication have been trending  in the computer science field. Thus led to an increase of pervasive use cases aiming to enhance the  life quality of human beings and preserve the environment. In addition to other use cases such as improving the manufacturing  process and providing better health care. Consequently, this has nurtured  the usage of networking concepts such as Information-Centric, Delay-Tolerant architectures and publish-subscribe messaging systems. Despite all that, there is still a lack of frameworks that facilitates the distribution and harmonization of pervasive use cases. A framework that would assist in deploying different use cases to edge devices in a network. Imagine being able to send a computation to all lamp posts in a specific area that switches them on once they detect a near by motion while taking into account the computation dependencies and required resources. %Further with the same framework but in a another context, being able to shut down all machines in a factory every Friday by a different computation.\\
 Therefore, we propose a software framework for distributing flows which are representations of computations describing use cases to smart devices in a network. The framework also takes care of the flows dependencies, resources, data communication, service discovery, delivering computations and data to challenged networks. It relies on the concepts of pervasive computing, information-centric and delay-tolerant networking. The framework enables the design, distribution, composition, deployment and execution of various flows to carry out different use cases.

\section{Use Cases}

%It is believed that development of smart pervasive computing devices that uses sensors and actuators are mainly grouped into smaller disconnected architectures and thus hard to create a composite framework in which all devices can communicate and integrate\cite{5470524}. In order to tackle this problem and to ensure that our computational model design is dynamic and flexible enough, we must ensure that our model is composable. By Composability we mean that computational models should be able to communicate, send and receive input and output data.

\chapter{Approach}\label{chapter:Approach}
\section{System Model }
Explain the overall architecture 


\section{Modeling of Input Sensor Data}
\subsection{Show how the different sensors have data been modeled to fit our requirements for further use in computations}
\subsection{Dealing with Resources}
\subsubsection{We cant make assumptions about resources}
\subsubsection{Resource capability description " Resource Configuration File"}
\subsubsection{Decoupling Resources}



\section{Pushing the Computation to the Edges "Nodes"}

\subsection{Execution Model}
- Which nodes should execute the data, is it all, some  or a specific nodes. Also, how is the model specified in the computation meta data.
- How do we know if a Computational Instance has been executed or not.
\subsubsection{Computation Meta-data}
\subsubsection{Dealing with Dependencies ( Shipping, Configuring)}


\section{Moving Data}
\subsection{Explain data distribution among several nodes to apply pervasive computing}

\subsubsection{Input Meta-data}
is it local, provided or collected data.

\section{Networking}
\subsection{SCAMPI }
